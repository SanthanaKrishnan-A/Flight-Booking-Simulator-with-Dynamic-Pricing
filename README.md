__Overview__

The Flight Booking Simulator is designed to demonstrate how a modern booking platform works. It connects a FastAPI backend (for handling business logic, dynamic pricing, and database operations) with a basic frontend using html, css and javascript(for user interaction).

Users can:

* Search for flights between destinations.

* View flight details like departure time, price, and available seats.

* Book tickets dynamically based on flight capacity and pricing logic.

__Features__:

👉 Flight Search by origin, destination, and date
👉 Dynamic Pricing (adjusts based on seat availability)
👉 Booking Management (create, view, and cancel bookings)
👉 MySQL Database integration for persistent storage
👉 RESTful API built with FastAPI
👉 CORS-enabled for frontend integration
👉 Frontend built using HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT
